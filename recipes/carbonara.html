<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>300 grams dry spaghetti</li>
    <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 cup pecorino freshly grated</li>
    <li>½-1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>2 table spoons olive oil</li>
    <li>100-150 grams guanciale </li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot boil the water, once the water is at a roaring boil add a little salt and the spaghetti, stir and cook until a little bit more than al dente.</li>
    <li>In a small/medium bowl beat until well combined the egg yolks, add the grated pecorino and pepper, beat to combine. Just before adding to the pan add 1/3 – 1/2 cup (80-120ml) of hot pasta water and mix to combine well.</li>
    <li>Slice the guanciale into short thin strips. In a large pan add the olive oil and guanciale, cook on medium heat until desired doneness, I like it on the crunchy side, the Italian not so much. Remove the guanciale to a clean plate. Do not remove the oil (& fat) from the pan.</li>
    <li>On medium/high heat, add the al dente pasta to the pan, and a 1/3-1/2 cup (80-120 ml) of hot pasta water and stir to combine,  remove the pan from the heat and add the egg mixture and quickly combine, add 1/3 -1/2 cup of hot pasta water and toss continually until well combined and creamy. Add the guanciale and gently mix.  Serve immediately topped with freshly grated pecorino and black pepper.</li>
